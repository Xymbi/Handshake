# Handshake
Handshake is software developed by Xymbi (Patrick Garcia)
This software is the acting hardware monitor for xyOS. Handshake detects any hardware changes in realtime and manages what has access to them. Hello works directly in hand with the OpenEco kernel to allow for Unity to run properly. This is what allows it to provide seamless integration with different devices and the hardware they supply. Any further development will be published here for the world to use for free.
